tkldev-detective can be installed as follows

1. Clone somewhere, I recommend cloning into ``/turnkey/public`` (creating
   intermediate directories as required)

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir -p /turnkey/public
        git clone git@github.com:turnkeylinux/tkldev-detective /turnkey/public/tkldev-detective

2. Add ``tkldev-detective`` to your path:

   .. code-block:: bash

        ln -s /turnkey/public/tkldev-detective/tkldev-detective /usr/local/bin

Usage
-----

Using ``tkldev-detective`` is as simple as running
``tkldev-detective lint <appliance>`` where ``<appliance>`` can be:

- the name of an appliance
- the path to an appliance
- the path to a specific file in an appliance

All of this provided you have the given appliance's build code on your machine.

E.g.

``tkldev-detective lint zoneminder``
